# Install for Windows

Installing Amethyst for Windows is easy. On the front page for Amethyst, at the bottom, you should've seen a direct download link for Amethyst Windows. **Right now, This does not work, as Amethyst is not at the point where there is a public release.** When it is available, you can click the Download button and recieve a zipped folder that contains Amethyst as a compiled Binary.

From here, you can assign a PATH yourself or let Amethyst try to make one for you. If you opt to let Amethyst do it for you, simply double-click the executable binary to run it. It will pop up with setup info and get prepared, alongside prompting you if you want a PATH auto-assigned.

Amethyst will always pop up with a CLI menu if zero commands are issued. Otherwise, Amethyst will run like a executable lib.

**It's important to note that Windows Defender, or any AV Product will flag Amethyst as malicious because Amethyst, as of right now, has zero certificates, like a Norton Cetificate (they are 200 dollars). You'd have to make a rule on your AV for Amethyst to run properly. Maybe one day i'll amass enough money to get a wildly expensive certificate to not have AV's screaming at people for a potential security hazard, but i simply cant right now.**
